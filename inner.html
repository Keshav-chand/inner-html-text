        Coding creates a set of instructions for computers to follow.
        These instructions determine what actions a computer can and cannot take.
        Computer programmers can also tell computers how to process data in better, faster ways.

        A programmer or developer writes instructions describing the information and tasks needed to create a visual or to perform a task.
        omputers scan extensive coded manuals very quickly, executing the tasks that create and run a successful website or application.
        Displaying an image or section of text, changing font styles, and opening emails all require instructions included in the coded manual.

        }, 10000);
